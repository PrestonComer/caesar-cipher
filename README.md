## Project Idea

This project introduces encryption and decryption, while also allowing me to refresh myself on C++.

## What Is Encryption
[Encryption](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/encryption) is the action of taking potentially sensetive data such as passwords, secret messages, or even nuclear launch codes and turning them into another data that must go through decryption before it can be recognized and therefore used. 

## What Is Decryption
[Decryption](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/decryption) is the action of taking encrypted data and attempting to turn it into the original data. Without some sort of key to use explaining how to do so decryption can be both difficult and time consuming.

## What Is Caesar Cipher
[Caesar Cipher](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6311/caesar-cipher) is an additive shift cipher meaning that given a string "hello" and a positive number such as 1 all characters in the string will be moved down the alphabet that many times. As such "hello" shifted by 1 will result in "ifmmp".

## How To Run Program
After downloading and compiling the .cpp file into an .exe or just running the .exe file provided in the repository you can just follow the instructions in the terminal.
